**[Live Link](https://ux-prodigy.netlify.app/)**

### A responsive, conversion-focused landing page for "UX Prodigy," a premium UX/UI mentorship program designed to help aspiring designers secure dream roles at top-tier companies like MAANG. This project was developed as part of the Think Sage Round 2 assignment to showcase frontend development skills, creativity, and UX thinking.

## Project Overview
The UX Prodigy landing page promotes a 1-on-1 mentorship program that empowers designers through personalized coaching, portfolio development, and job placement support. The page is designed to drive signups via a compelling user journey, clear value propositions, and trust-building elements like success stats and a money-back guarantee.

This project was built to meet the requirements of the Think Sage Round 2 assignment, emphasizing responsive design, intuitive UX, and a modern aesthetic optimized for Meta ads conversion.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Interactive Navigation**: Fixed navbar with a hamburger menu for mobile and smooth scrolling for anchor links.
- **Engaging Hero Section**: Highlights the program’s value with stats (e.g., 95% job placement rate, 500+ graduates).
- **Feature Cards**: Showcases key offerings like 1-on-1 mentorship, live workshops, and career coaching.
- **Process Timeline**: Visual roadmap outlining the program’s structured journey.
- **Pricing Plans**: Clear, tiered pricing with a highlighted "Pro" plan to encourage upgrades.
- **FAQ Accordion**: Interactive FAQ section for quick answers to common questions.
- **Signup Form**: Simple form with basic validation for lead capture.
- **Footer**: Includes social links and contact information.

## TechStack Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS3**: Custom styles with CSS variables, Flexbox, Grid, and media queries for responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity (e.g., hamburger menu toggle, FAQ accordion, form validation).
- **Font Awesome**: Icons for visual enhancement.
- **Google Fonts**: Poppins font for a modern, readable typography.
- **Netlify**: Hosting for the live deployement.

## Setup Instructions
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Naveen-YN/UX-Prodigy-Landing-Page.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd UX-Prodigy-Landing-Page
   ```

3. **Open the Project**:
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the landing page.
   - Alternatively, use a local development server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code) for a better experience.

4. **Dependencies**:
   - No additional installations are required, as all dependencies (Font Awesome, Google Fonts) are loaded via CDN.

## Design and UX Considerations
- **Why This Idea**: The mentorship program targets the growing demand for UX designers, appealing to career-driven individuals aiming for MAANG roles.
- **Thought Process**: The page follows a conversion-focused structure: a bold hero, detailed features, a clear process, transparent pricing, FAQs, and a strong CTA. Trust signals like stats and guarantees address user concerns.
- **UX Focus**: Prioritized visual hierarchy, scannable content, and intuitive navigation. Interactive elements (e.g., accordion, smooth scrolling) enhance engagement, while responsive design ensures accessibility.
- **Design Choices**: Used a professional color palette (indigo, gradient accents), Poppins font for readability, and a blurred navbar for modern aesthetics.
